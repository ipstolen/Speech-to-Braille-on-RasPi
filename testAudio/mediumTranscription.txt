Is this the season of the rematch in college football?
Prior to the 2025 season, rematches in the College Football Playoff were a relative rarity. 
With only four teams in the field for the majority of the playoff's existence, it wasn't especially common for two teams that already played earlier in the season to meet again in the playoff bracket.
But when the playoff expanded to 12 teams, an increase in both bids and title pathways made rematches more likely -- the first 12-team playoff in 2024 produced as many rematches as there had been in the entire 10-year history of the four-team system.
This year though the number of rematches has spiked.
Two of the four games in the first round of the 2025 College Football Playoff alone were rematches.
Then in the quarterfinals Georgia and Ole Miss met up in another rematch.
Now with Oregon and Indiana facing off in the semifinals a fourth rematch will be on college football fans screens next week.
