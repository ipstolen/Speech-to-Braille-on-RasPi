Oregon can play some nasty defense too. 
Coach Dan Lanning challenged that group after saying it fell short of its standard in a fifty one to thirty four win over James Madison in the first round last week when the Ducks gave up five hundred yards of offense.
It was a completely different story in the quarterfinals against one of the most explosive offenses in the country.
Oregon forced four turnovers and had four sacks and seven tackles for loss and the Ducks recorded their first bowl shutout since World War one.
Brandon Finney Jr. had two interceptions and a fumble recovery in the win while Teitum Tuioti formed a fearsome rushing duo from the edge.
We will stick with defense here to note how well Tuioti has played in the second half of the season for the Oregon defense.
Tuioti, the Ducks third leading tackler, has seven sacks in the past six games and especially made his presence felt against the Red Raiders.
He noted that during the practice leading up to the game against Texas Tech, the coaches emphasized creating turnovers to keep the Red Raiders off the field. 
Oregon had only seventeen takeaways in thirteen games before Thursday.
They can reach the title game if Oregon can find its rhythm on offense.
There is no question the Oregon offense did not play its best game, but some of that is because the Texas Tech defense created problems for the Ducks completely shutting down the run game and forcing them out of their trademark rhythm. 
Dan Lanning also went for it eight times on fourth down, converting just four chances.
It is one thing to be aggressive when you believe you are in control of the game, another if the game seems like it can swing on a fourth-down call.
If Oregon can get into an offensive groove and stay out of some of those fourth down situations and the defense can stay aggressive they have a great chance to reach the title game
